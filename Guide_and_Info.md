# Laravel Project Setup and Installation Guide
Welcome to the setup and installation guide for the Laravel project! This guide will walk you through the steps required to set up the project on your local machine. Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth setup process.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

* Composer
* Node.js and npm
* Git

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

## Step 2: Install Composer Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory using the terminal:

`cd your-laravel-project`

Install the project's PHP dependencies using Composer:

`composer install`

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Copy the .env.example file and create a new .env file:

`cp .env.example .env`

Generate a unique application key:

`php artisan key:generate`

## Step 4: Database Migration and Seeding
Run database migrations and seed the database with sample data:

`php artisan migrate --seed`

## Step 5: Start the Development Server
Start the Laravel development server:

`php artisan serve`

Your Laravel application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can access it in your web browser.

## Step 6: Install and Set Up Vite
If your project uses Vite for frontend development, follow these steps. Otherwise, you can skip this section. In this project I used vite.

Install npm dependencies:

`npm install`

Compile and watch for frontend changes:

`npm run dev`

## Additional Steps

Troubleshooting: If you encounter any issues during setup, please refer to the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) or seek help from the community.

Configuration: Review the `.env` file to configure database connections, mail settings, and other application-specific configurations.

Customization: Customize the project according to your needs by modifying routes, controllers, views, and assets.
